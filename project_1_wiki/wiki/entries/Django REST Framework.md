# Django REST Framework

[Django REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) is a **powerful and flexible toolkit** for building Web APIs.

Some reasons you might want to use REST framework:

* The Web browsable API is a huge usability win for your developers.
* Authentication policies including packages for OAuth1a and OAuth2.
* Serialization that supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources.
* Customizable all the way down - just use regular function-based views if you don't need the more powerful features.
* Extensive documentation, and great community support.
